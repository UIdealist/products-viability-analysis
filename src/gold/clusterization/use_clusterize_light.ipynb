That holds true for this \"new\" version of Oregon Trail, which is actually based on the older, more stable second edition of the game; one of the last products produced by the respected Minnesota publisher MECC. Children start their trek westward by typing in their name, profession, and the names of people in their party. They then navigate through a series of complex menus to purchase supplies and stock their wagon. Unfortunately, some of the flaws with version two have also been carried into this edition. Children often overload their wagon, and the program doesn\\'t help them visualize what they have. Kids also have trouble with some new phrases that could be better defined, such as \"caulk the wagons\" and \"ford the river\". Along the trail, it is possible to hunt, fish and interact with characters. So what\\'s different? At each main break in the adventure, children can listen to campfire stories about three real life children who actually traveled the Oregon Trail. Our testers loved these vignettes and felt like they helped them better understand what the journey was really like. The children\\'s journal is also on the CD as a PDF file, which makes good reading. Despite its flaws, this edition of Oregon Trail is the best yet, and a great way to experience American history. --', 'From Children\\'s Software Revue® -- \"Subscribe Now!\"', 'See more']",

To help kids solve cases or gather information for school assignments, a rich electronic database is included. It features essays, spectacular color photos, and video clips from The National Geographic Society.\", 'Review', \"Kids can once again search for criminals across the globe with this updated version of the classic geography program. Carmen Sandiego is on another spree of mischief, stealing the Olympic flame and pilfering all the salt from the Dead Sea! Children are given the task of tracking down Carmen and her cohorts, country by country. As they travel to 50 different locations to follow leads, players tour each area to get the lay of the land. While talking to inhabitants while narrowing down the clues, they'll hear bits of twelve other languages. To aid their sleuthing, children can use a talking foreign language dictionary or directly access an Internet link to maps, satellite images and geographic resources. Testers greatly enjoyed the program but found that they needed an almanac when trying to figure out the clues. Kids loved the suspense of the game and especially liked the scrolling panoramic graphics. The program is very educational as well as entertaining. In the Multimedia Library, children can watch National Geographic Society videos and access essays, maps and color photos of locations across the globe. Guided tours are available so that kids can learn world geography as well as facts about international music, art and history. Other skills emphasized include database research skills, deductive reasoning and map reading. We highly recommend this terrific CD-ROM, to both schools and homes- just make sure you've got an almanac handy.\", 'Teaches:', 'geography, facts about 50 countries, language, logic', 'Age Range:', \"9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 Copyright © 2000 Children's Software Revue --\", 'From Children\\'s Software Revue® -- \"Subscribe Now!\"', 'See more']",

The game engages children with clever and colorful spooky scenarios and builds learning skills through riddles, puzzles, and games.', 'Review', \"Your eyes water, but you won't give up. You're searching for a small nut hiding somewhere in a detailed picture of a clock face. You've found the first nut- an acorn. After some intensive looking you spot a metal nut (as in bolt). You click on it to solve the riddle and win another clue toward how to escape from the spooky house. Our testers simply wouldn't stop playing this second program in the I Spy CD-ROM series, which hides thirteen of Jean Marzallo's I Spy puzzles inside a dark mansion. Kids must find their way out of the mansion by solving each riddle. Children look for hidden objects camouflaged in a collection of exotic dolls, a spooky old butterfly collection and an amazing assortment of keys, buttons, paper clips, spiders and so on. Because the child has signed into the program, the software occasionally weaves the child's name into the picture. Also hidden among the rooms is a three-level concentration game, a timed matching game and a create-your-own I Spy puzzle, which lets children make their own puzzles and write their own riddles. It's hard to find fault with the design of this program. Be forewarned that children will be calling for help when they can't find that last fish eye, however. We were pleased to see some innovative features- a moving concentration game and a dark attic where objects are found with the beam of a flashlight. The combination of riddles and games gives the program plenty of replay value and provides a fun way to experiment with language. Because the computer keeps track of the puzzles that have been completed, it's possible to jump to a fresh challenge at any time. This makes this program very easy to get started with, yet extremely challenging, even for adults.\", 'Teaches:', 'reading, language, rhyming, classification, logic, memory', 'Age Range:', '6, 7, 8, 9, 10 --', 'From Children\\'s Software Revue® -- \"Subscribe Now!\"', 'See more']",
